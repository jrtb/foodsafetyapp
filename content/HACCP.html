<h3><a name="4">What is HACCP?</a></h3>

<p>HACCP is defined as "A system that identifies, evaluates, and controls hazards that are significant for food safety" by Codex Alimentarius, the consortium that harmonizes international food standards between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization.</p>

<p>This system was developed during NASA's attempts during the 1960s to be the first country to land a man on the moon. NASA realized the importance of ensuring the safety of astronaut food during this high profile space race and partnered with the Pillsbury Company to create a system for guaranteeing the safety of manufactured foods.</p>

<p>Whereas PRPs provide the foundation for food safety, HACCP is a systematic method for developing a food safety plan and managing it on a daily basis. HACCP is an acronym that stands for Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points.</p>

<p>There are 7 Principles of HACCP:
<ol>
<li>Conduct a hazard analysis</li>
<li>Determine Critical Control Points (CCPs)</li>
<li>Establish critical limit(s)</li>
<li>Establish a system to monitor control of each CCP</li>
<li>Establish the corrective action to be taken when monitoring indicates that a particular CCP is not under control</li>
<li>Establish procedures for verification to confirm that the HACCP system is working effectively</li>
<li>Establish documentation concerning all procedures and records appropriate to these principles and their application.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>The <u>Food and Drug Administration</u> (FDA) and the <u>United States Department of Agriculture</u> (USDA) mandate the use of HACCP programs for juice and seafood (FDA) and meat (USDA) as an effective approach to food safety and protecting public health. </p>

<p>The FDA created separate regulations for manufacturers of fish and juice products to manage HACCP systems (no other food manufacturers are required by FDA to manage HACCP systems). These specific regulations for juice manufacturers are listed in Title 21 Section 120. Title 21 Section 123 contains the requirements for fish and fishery products. While other manufacturers are not required by federal agencies to implement HACCP systems, it is very common to do so because HACCP systems are required by non-government organization (NGO) food safety standards.</p>

<h3><a name="5">HACCP Certification</a></h3>

<!--
<p>NC State's Department of Food, Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences offers online HACCP training program to teach students how to implement and manage the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system.</p>
<p>This was designed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a food safety management system for controlling food hazards. By completing this course, students will earn a HACCP certification.</p>
 -->
<p>Students will discover the 12-step process for developing and implementing a HACCP plan. Additionally, students will learn techniques for managing both HACCP and prerequisite programs to ensure food products will be safe and wholesome.</p>

<p>This HACCP Alliance approved course is intended for both industry personnel seeking HACCP certification. It is a sixteen-week online course consists of videos, an online textbook, quizzes, activities and discussion forums. Students will earn their <a href="http://foodsafety.ncsu.edu/online-haccp-training-get-certified/">certificate of completion from the International HACCP Alliance</a> upon completion of the course.</p>

<p>To learn more about receiving a HACCP Certification visit our <a href="http://foodsafety.ncsu.edu/basics-of-food-safety/">Food Safety and Education Training website</a>.</p>
