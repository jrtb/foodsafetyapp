<h3><a name="3">What are Pre-Requisite Programs?</a></h3>

<p>Pre-Requisite Programs control food safety hazards in the manufacturing <b>environment</b>. The International Organization for Standards defined PRPs as "basic conditions and activities that are necessary to maintain a hygienic environment throughout the food chain suitable for production, handling and provision of safe end products and safe food for human consumption."</p>

<p>Formal definitions for PRPs have been published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Academy for Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF)
<ul>
<li>"Practices and conditions needed prior to and during the implementation of HACCP and which are essential to food safety" (WHO 1999).</li>
<li>"Procedures, including Good Manufacturing Practices, that address operational conditions, providing the foundation for the HACCP system" (NACMCF, 1997).</li></p>
</ul>
<p>Notice how the wording of these definitions emphasizes the food safety pyramid concept: it is essential to first establish PRPs and then an effective HACCP system. </p>

<p>
This course is based on the international technical specification for PRPs (ISO 22002-1) in food manufacturing operations worldwide. There are 15 PRPs within this specification (each of which is a building block of the food safety pyramid):
<ol>
<li>Construction and layout of buildings</li>
<li>Layout of premises and workplaces</li>
<li>Utilities, including air, water, and energy</li>
<li>Waste disposal</li>
<li>Equipment suitability, cleaning and maintenance</li>
<li>Management of purchased materials</li>
<li>Measures for prevention of cross contamination</li>
<li>Cleaning and sanitizing</li>
<li>Pest control</li>
<li>Personnel hygiene and employee facilities</li>
<li>Rework</li>
<li>Product recall procedures</li>
<li>Warehousing</li>
<li>Product information and consumer awareness</li>
<li>Food defense, biovigilance, and bioterrorism</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Food manufacturing environments are complex, however their food safety considerations can be simplified into the 15 topics specified in ISO 22002-1. For example, there are infinite possibilities of what the construction, design and layout of food manufacturing facilities could be (ISO 22002-1 specification #1 and #2), each of which affects the food safety in the environment. Typically there are many utilities going into the facility, such as air and water (ISO 22002-1 specification #3). Failure to handle waste produced during manufacturing (ISO 22002-1 specification #4) would affect food safety in the manufacturing environment. </p>

<p>This course establishes the framework for the food safety pyramid. It will teach you about food safety hazards and challenge you to evaluate and implement PRPs in food manufacturing operations. In addition, it is a precursor to HACCP, which has become the global model for food safety management.</p>

<h3><a name="4">What is HACCP?</a></h3>

<p>HACCP is defined as "A system that identifies, evaluates, and controls hazards that are significant for food safety" by Codex Alimentarius, the consortium that harmonizes international food standards between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization.</p>

<p>This system was developed during NASA's attempts during the 1960s to be the first country to land a man on the moon. NASA realized the importance of ensuring the safety of astronaut food during this high profile space race and partnered with the Pillsbury Company to create a system for guaranteeing the safety of manufactured foods.</p>

<p>Whereas PRPs provide the foundation for food safety, HACCP is a systematic method for developing a food safety plan and managing it on a daily basis. HACCP is an acronym that stands for Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points.</p>

<p>There are 7 Principles of HACCP:
<ol>
<li>Conduct a hazard analysis</li>
<li>Determine Critical Control Points (CCPs)</li>
<li>Establish critical limit(s)</li>
<li>Establish a system to monitor control of each CCP</li>
<li>Establish the corrective action to be taken when monitoring indicates that a particular CCP is not under control</li>
<li>Establish procedures for verification to confirm that the HACCP system is working effectively</li>
<li>Establish documentation concerning all procedures and records appropriate to these principles and their application.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>The <u>Food and Drug Administration</u> (FDA) and the <u>United States Department of Agriculture</u> (USDA) mandate the use of HACCP programs for juice and seafood (FDA) and meat (USDA) as an effective approach to food safety and protecting public health. </p>

<p>The FDA created separate regulations the requirements for manufacturers of fish and juice products to manage HACCP systems (no other food manufacturers are required by FDA to manage HACCP systems). These specific regulations for juice manufacturers are listed in Section 120 . Section 123 contains the requirements for fish and fishery products. While other manufacturers are not required by federal agencies to implement HACCP systems, it is very common to do so because HACCP systems are required by non-government organization (NGO) food safety standards. HACCP is also recognized as an effective system for achieving food safety objectives.</p>

<h3><a name="5">PRPs vs. Critical Control Points</a></h3>

<p>Critical Control Points (CCPs) are defined as specific processing steps at which controls can be applied. These points are essential to prevent or eliminate a food safety hazard or reduce it to an acceptable level. A common CCP is manufacturing equipment which involves cooking processes. For example, it is necessary to apply a thermal treatment to raw milk that destroys all pathogenic (disease-causing) bacteria because this eliminates a significant food safety hazard.</p>

<p>Whereas PRPs are concerned with the manufacturing <b>environment</b>, CCPs are concerned with <b>specific hazards</b> that could result in foodborne illness and are likely to occur. One way to distinguish PRPs from CCPs is to consider which hazards should continue to be controlled in the event of a power outage in a processing plant.  For example, pest control practices should occur whether production is in process or not (no power required) and is an example of a pre-requisite program.  On the other hand, a milk pasteurizing system is commonly a CCP; it will only be used during the production process, which requires power.</p>

<h3><a name="6">PRPs vs. Good Manufacturing Practices</a></h3>

<p>Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) are federal regulations enforced by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  They were promulgated from the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, which was passed by the United States Congress. GMPs apply to all food manufacturers in the United States. However, manufacturers of red meat, poultry and shell egg manufactures are exempt from the GMPs. These manufacturers are regulated by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).

The FDA's regulations on Good Manufacturing Practices are listed in Section 110 in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. There are 8 sanitation conditions and practices that processors shall address under the FDA's requirements:
<ol>
<li><b>Water</b> that comes into contact with food or food contact surfaces</li>
<li>Condition and cleanliness of <b>food contact surfaces</b></li>
<li><b>Prevention of cross-contamination</b> from insanitary objects</li>
<li>Maintenance of <b>hand washing, hand sanitizing, and toilet facilities</b></li>
<li>Protection of food, <b>food packaging</b> material and food contact surfaces from adulteration with materials such as lubricants, fuel, pesticides, etc.</li>
<li>Proper <b>labeling, storage and use of toxic compounds</b></li>
<li>Control of <b>employee health conditions</b> that could result in the microbiological contamination of food, food contact surfaces and food packaging.</li>
<li>Exclusion of <b>pests</b> from the food plant</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3><a name="7">Operational PRPs</a></h3>

<p>ISO 22000 is the international standard for food safety. The 2005 edition (ISO 22000:2005) introduced the term <b>Operational Pre-Requisite Programs</b> (OPRPs) as "a PRP identified by the hazard analysis as essential in order to control the likelihood of introducing in the product(s) of or in the processing environment."</p>

<p>What is the difference between PRPs, OPRPs and CCPs? The definition for OPRPs does sound similar to both PRPs and CCPs. The differences between these programs are so subtle there is controversy between food safety experts' opinions. Some professionals suggest the differences are too subtle to effectively distinguish and manage PRPs vs. OPRPs vs. CCPs in food manufacturing operations, whereas others suggest the distinction of OPRPs enhances food safety in manufacturing operations.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the subtle difference between OPRPs and PRPs and CCPs can be interpreted.</p>

<p><b>OPRP</b>s are different from CCPs because they are concerned with food safety hazards in the <b>processing environment</b>, whereas <b>CCP</b>s control specific hazards in the <b>food manufacturing processes</b>.</p>

<p>The distinction between OPRPs and PRPs is that <b>OPRP</b>s are concerned with specific hazards within the food manufacturing environment that have a <b>narrow scope</b>. For example, a common concern in food manufacturing is cross contamination of allergens between side-by-side processing lines that manufacture products containing allergen ingredients (e.g. peanuts) and others that do not. The task of separating all food contact surfaces between two processing lines in this kind of an environment is much more specific than the task of doing so in a processing environment that only has one processing line running.</p>

<h3><a name="8">Standards vs. Regulations</a></h3>

<p>Regulations and standards for PRPs were first laid out for the meat industry in 1890, when it was specified that all meat products require inspection prior to being sold. All events in the early 20th century included basic regulations involving the federal agencies FDA and FSIS. These agencies continued refining these regulations through the latter half of the century. The most recent passing of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) of 2011, however, marks perhaps the most significant food safety regulation in history. Most of the outcomes of the FSMA are yet to be realized, as many of the proposed rules are not yet final rules.</p>

<p>The PRP standards for non-government organizations (NGOs) such as ISO and the Safe Quality Food Institute (SQFi) are, in contrast to regulations, new to the industry. The first of these supply chain standards were the standards the British Retail Consortium (BRC) created. These standards were created so that food companies could have a set of non-government standards to use while auditing the suppliers of their products and ingredients. Since then, more schemes have been developed. The Global Food Safety Institute (GFSI) was formed in 2000 to achieve harmonization of all these food safety standards and reduce audit duplication throughout the supply chain.</p>

<h3><a name="9">Auditors and inspectors</a></h3>

<p>The expanding global nature of the food supply and the regulations and standards for manufacturing food products have opened many career opportunities for ensuring food manufacturing operations are compliant with the various requirements.</p>

<p>Within this career field, there are several options. The federal government agencies (FDA and FSIS) have inspectors who evaluate whether food manufacturing operations are compliant with the relevant parts in the Code of Federal Regulations. On the other hand, auditors determine whether the same processing plants are compliant with the various NGO standards benchmarked by GFSI (e.g. SQF and BRC).  Some auditors work for firms and consulting agencies that provide auditing services as a third party. Also, many large food manufacturing companies hire their own auditors who perform 2nd party audits, in which they directly evaluate the suppliers of their food ingredients and materials. Just about every food manufacturing operation responsible for achieving food safety standards for their customers also hire internal auditors who work onsite to ensure compliance on a daily basis.</p>
